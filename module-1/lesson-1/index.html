                <h1>Titanium. So strong. So lite. So Pro</h1>
                <p>
                  Apple used titanium on the iPhone 15 Pro to ensure the
                  durability and lightness of the device. Titanium is a strong
                  and lightweight metal that allows Apple to design a slimmer
                  and lighter frame. Apple also used a new thermo-mechanical
                  process to bond titanium and recycled aluminum with incredible
                  strength. The iPhone 15 Pro is approximately nine percent
                  lighter than the previous generation.For years, the iPhone Pro
                  has been rimmed with a heavy steel frame, but not for much
                  longer. With the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple may switch from a steel
                  frame to one made from titanium, and not just because it
                  sounds cooler. Titanium offers many advantages over steel, not
                  least of which is that it is much lighter, which would solve
                  the iPhone Pro's most embarrassing problem compared to the
                  regular iPhone. But titanium has its problems, too, although
                  it's likely that Apple has used its extensive experience with
                  metals to work around these.We know Apple for its cool
                  computer products, but it is also one of the most advanced
                  metal companies in the world, and it even has a team dedicated
                  to metallurgy. Most notable is its knowledge of aluminum. Over
                  the years, it has pioneered a manufacturing process to mill
                  its computer cases from solid billets of aluminum (the Unibody
                  process), and it also recycles the waste aluminum from iPads
                  to make some MacBooks.

                <p>
                  The iPhone 15 Pro introduces USB 3.0 speeds, the ability to
                  record video directly to an external hard drive, a new Action
                  button instead of the Ring/Silent switch, and a titanium build
                  for increased strength and comfort. Prices start at $799 for
                  the iPhone 15 and $999 for the iPhone 15 Pro. All models go on
                  sale on September 22, 2023.Apple’s new iPhone 15 Pro is the
                  latest flagship smartphone from the tech giant. It was
                  released on September 22, 2023, and has some new features and
                  improvements over the previous iPhone 14 Pro. Here are some of
                  the highlights of the iPhone 15 Pro: It has a new customizable
                  Action Button in place of the long-standing mute switch. You
                  can assign different functions to the button, such as
                  launching an app, taking a screenshot, or activating Siri. It
                  has a new titanium design that makes the phone a bit lighter
                  and more durable. The titanium also gives the phone a sleek
                  and elegant look. It has a revamped A17 Pro chip under the
                  hood that aims to flex Apple’s chip-making prowess. The chip
                  has a new GPU design that boosts gaming performance and
                  supports ProRes video recording. It has a 48MP main camera
                  with a 120mm telephoto lens that offers the longest optical
                  zoom in iPhone ever. It also has a new Tetraprism feature that
                  enhances low-light photography. It has a spatial video capture
                  feature that lets you record immersive audio with your videos.
                  You can then relive them on Apple Vision Pro, a new VR headset
                  from Apple. It has USB-C compatibility that allows you to
                  charge your phone faster and transfer data more easily. You
                  can also swap drives and keep filming without interrupting
                  your workflow. It has Roadside Assistance via satellite,
                  Emergency SOS via satellite, and Crash Detection features that
                  can help you in case of an emergency. These features use
                  satellite signals to connect you to help when cellular
                  networks are unavailable.

                  The MacBook Pro is a line of Mac laptops made by Apple Inc.
                  Introduced in January 2006, it is the higher-end lineup in the
                  MacBook family, sitting above the consumer-focused MacBook
                  Air. It is currently sold with 14-inch and 16-inch screens,
                  all using Apple silicon M-series chips.The original MacBook
                  Pro used the design of the PowerBook G4, but replaced the
                  PowerPC G4 chips with Intel Core processors, added a webcam,
                  and introduced the MagSafe power connector. The 15-inch model
                  was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April.
                  Later revisions added Intel Core 2 Duo processors and
                  LED-backlit displays. The unibody 15-inch model debuted in
                  October 2008, with a 17-inch variant added in January 2009. In
                  June of the same year, a 13-inch variant was added to the
                  MacBook Pro lineup. Called the "unibody" model because its
                  case was machined from a single piece of aluminum, it had a
                  thinner flush display, a redesigned trackpad whose entire
                  surface consisted of a single clickable button, and a
                  redesigned keyboard. Updates brought Intel Core i5 and i7
                  processors and introduced Intel's Thunderbolt. The Retina
                  MacBook Pro was released in 2012: the 15-inch in June, a
                  13-inch model in October. It is thinner than its predecessor,
                  made solid-state storage (SSD) standard, added HDMI, and
                  included a high-resolution Retina display. It eliminated
                  Ethernet, FireWire ports and the optical drive. The Touch Bar
                  MacBook Pro, released in October 2016, adopted USB-C for all
                  data ports and power and included a shallower
                  "butterfly"-mechanism keyboard. On all but the base model, the
                  function keys were replaced with a touchscreen strip called
                  the Touch Bar with a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power
                  button.

                  iMac is a family of all-in-one Mac desktop computers designed
                  and built by Apple Inc. It has been the primary part of
                  Apple's consumer desktop offerings since its debut in August
                  1998, and has evolved through seven distinct forms. In its
                  original form, the iMac G3 had a gumdrop or egg-shaped look,
                  with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, translucent
                  plastic case, which was refreshed early on with a sleeker
                  design notable for its slot-loaded optical drive. The second
                  major revision, the iMac G4, moved the design to a
                  hemispherical base containing all the main components and an
                  LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third
                  and fourth major revisions, the iMac G5 and the Intel iMac
                  respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the
                  display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and
                  down on a simple metal base. The fifth major revision
                  (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was
                  thinner and used anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the
                  entire front. The seventh major revision (late 2012) uses a
                  different display unit, omits the SuperDrive, and uses
                  different production techniques from the older unibody
                  versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older
                  models, with an edge thickness of 5.9 mm (but the same maximum
                  depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup and includes
                  solid-state drive (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple
                  Fusion Drive, a hybrid of solid-state and hard disk drives.
                  This version of the iMac was announced in October 2012, with
                  the 21.5-inch (55 cm) version released in November and the
                  27-inch (69 cm) version in December; these were refreshed in
                  September 2013, with new Haswell processors, faster graphics,
                  faster and larger SSD options and 802.11ac Wi-Fi cards. On
                  July 27, 2010, Apple updated its line of iMacs to feature the
                  new Intel Core "i-series" processors across the line. The
                  21.5" models now feature the Core i3 processor, but these are
                  upgradable to the Core i5. The high-end 27" features a
                  Quad-Core i5 processor, which is upgradable to a Quad-Core i7.
                  On this date, Apple also announced its new "Apple Magic
                  Trackpad" peripheral, a trackpad similar to that of the
                  MacBook Pro for use with iMac or any other Apple computer.
                  Apple also introduced a AA NiMH battery charger intended to
                  simplify the use of batteries in these peripherals. Apple
                  offers an option to use a solid-state drive instead of a large
                  mechanical drive. On May 3, 2011, Apple updated its iMac line
                  with the introduction of Intel Thunderbolt technology and
                  Intel Core i5 and i7 Sandy Bridge processors as well as a 1
                  mega pixel high definition FaceTime camera, features which
                  were first introduced in the MacBook Pro line in February
                  2011.

                  The Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple
                  Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented
                  capabilities, and wireless telecommunication, and integrates
                  with iOS and other Apple products and services. The Apple
                  Watch was released in April 2015, and quickly became the
                  best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the
                  second quarter of fiscal 2015, and more than 115 million
                  people were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December
                  2022. Apple has introduced a new generation of the Apple Watch
                  with improved internal components each September—each labeled
                  by Apple as a 'Series', with certain exceptions.[a] Each
                  Series has been initially sold in multiple variants defined by
                  the watch casing's material, color, and size (except for the
                  budget watches Series 1 and SE, available only in aluminum,[
                  and the Ultra, available only in 49 mm uncolored titanium),
                  and beginning with Series 3, by the option in the aluminum
                  variants for LTE cellular connectivity, which comes standard
                  with the other materials. The band included with the watch can
                  be selected from multiple options from Apple, and watch
                  variants in aluminum co-branded with Nike and in stainless
                  steel co-branded with Hermès are also offered, which include
                  exclusive bands, colors, and digital watch faces carrying
                  those companies' branding.[14] The Apple Watch operates in
                  conjunction with the user's iPhone for functions such as
                  configuring the watch and syncing data with iPhone apps, but
                  can separately connect to a Wi-Fi network for data-reliant
                  purposes, including communications, app use, and audio
                  streaming. LTE-equipped models can also perform these
                  functions over a mobile network, and can make and receive
                  phone calls independently when the paired iPhone is not nearby
                  or is powered-off, substantially reducing the need for an
                  iPhone after initial setup. The oldest iPhone model that is
                  compatible with any given Apple Watch depends on the version
                  of the operating system installed on each device. As of
                  September 2022, new Apple Watches come with watchOS 9
                  preinstalled and require an iPhone running iOS 16, which is
                  available for the iPhone 8 and later.

                  of iOS and iPadOS-based tablet computers that are developed by
                  Apple Inc., first introduced on January 27, 2010. The iPad
                  range consists of the original iPad lineup and the flagship
                  products iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro. The iPhone's iOS
                  operating system (OS) was initially used for the iPad but in
                  September 2019, its OS was switched to a fork of iOS called
                  iPadOS that has better support for the device's hardware and
                  its user interface is customized for the tablets' larger
                  screens. The iPad's App Store is subject to application and
                  content approval. Many older devices are susceptible to
                  jailbreaking, which circumvents these restrictions. The
                  original iPad was well-received for its software and was
                  recognized as one of the most-influential inventions of 2010.
                  As of the third quarter of 2021, iPad had a market share of
                  34.6%; beside personal use, the iPad is used in the business,
                  education, healthcare, and technology sectors. There are two
                  variants of iPad; one has only Wi-Fi and one has support for
                  cellular networks. Accessories include the Apple Pencil, Smart
                  Case, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard,
                  and several adapters. In May 2004, Apple filed a design
                  trademark patent in Europe for a handheld computer,
                  hypothetically referencing the iPad, beginning a new round of
                  speculation that led to a 2003 report of Apple-affiliated
                  manufacturer Quanta leaking Apple's orders for wireless
                  displays.

                  AirPods are wireless Bluetooth earbuds designed by Apple Inc.
                  They were first announced on September 7, 2016, alongside the
                  iPhone 7. Within two years, they became Apple's most popular
                  accessory.[4][5] AirPods are Apple's entry-level wireless
                  headphones, sold alongside the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. In
                  addition to playing audio, the AirPods contain a microphone
                  that filters out background noise as well as built-in
                  accelerometers and optical sensors capable of detecting taps
                  and pinches (e.g. double-tap or pinch to pause audio) and
                  placement within the ear, which enables automatic pausing of
                  audio when they are taken out.[6] On March 20, 2019, Apple
                  released the second-generation AirPods, which feature the H1
                  chip, longer talk time, and hands-free "Hey Siri" support. An
                  optional wireless charging case which costs extra was added in
                  the offerings. On October 26, 2021, Apple released the
                  third-generation AirPods, which feature an external redesign
                  with shorter stems similar to AirPods Pro, spatial audio, IPX4
                  water resistance, longer battery life, and MagSafe charging
                  capability.AirPods have been criticized for their high price;
                  however, at launch they were actually priced less than most
                  "true wireless" earbuds on the market (e.g. the Samsung Gear
                  IconX and Bragi Dash) and remain competitively priced with
                  similar products from other major brands.[65][66][67] Since
                  AirPods can easily be worn for long periods of time, AirPods
                  have also had an effect on how people interact with each
                  other. Having earphones in is generally perceived as a "do not
                  disturb" signal, and some AirPods users use this fact to
                  strategically avoid awkward small talk.[68] But in the
                  collaborative workplace, constant use of AirPods has sometimes
                  been interpreted as a sign of disrespect to fellow co-workers,
                  causing conflict in the office.

                  be.Whether you buy things with Apple Pay or with the
                  laser‑etched titanium card, Apple Card can do lots of things
                  no other credit card can do. Apple Card is a credit card
                  created by Apple Inc. and issued by Goldman Sachs, designed
                  primarily to be used with Apple Pay on an Apple device such as
                  an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac. Currently, it is
                  available only in the United States, with 6.7 million American
                  cardholders in early 2022. Apple has designed a titanium Apple
                  Card for shopping at locations where Apple Pay contactless
                  payment is not accepted.[21] The logos on the card are
                  engraved, and the cardholder's name is laser-etched onto the
                  card.[22][23] The card has no card number, CVV security code,
                  expiration date, or signature printed on the card.[21] On
                  delivery, users with the iPhone XS and above can activate the
                  physical card by moving their phone near a NFC tag concealed
                  within the card's packaging.[24] Users with an iPhone X or
                  earlier need to open the Wallet app before tapping the phone
                  against the card.
